If s1 is account1’s serialiser and s2 os account2’s serialiser, then
exchange is called from an environment protected by both s1 and
s2. Within that environment a call to ((account1 'withdraw)
difference) is made which will use s1 call (withdraw difference),
however s1 is already protecting the call to exchange and so withdraw
can’t be evaluated until exchange has completed which will never
complete.
